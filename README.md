# Moonball Network | Documentation Page

This is the documentation website for https://raj.moonball.io/bpsapi/docs  
Made by @rajdave69

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static Documentation website generator.

### Installation

```shell
$ yarn
```
or 

```npm
npm install
```

### Local Development

```shell
$ yarn start
```
or 

```npm
npm run dev
```
This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```shell
$ yarn build
```
or 
```npm
npm run build
```
This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Just put the files in the `/build` directory on your web-server.

**Note** : This website is meant to be run in the `/docs` directory of a website and not `/`. Edit this in `docusaurus.config.js`.
