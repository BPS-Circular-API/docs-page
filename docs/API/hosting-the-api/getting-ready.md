# Getting Started

In this section, you will learn how to get the environment ready to run the API.

You can either host it on Pterodactyl or run it locally.
You will also need a working web-server configuration for the png generation to work.

:::warning Hosting the API requires basic CS knowledge.

Hosting the API anywhere other than locally for development requires you to have basic computer-science and networking knowledge.
