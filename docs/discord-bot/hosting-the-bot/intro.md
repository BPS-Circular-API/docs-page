# Getting Started

In this section, you will learn how to get the environment ready to run the Discord Bot.

You'll need a dedicated server that runs 24/7, to keep the bot up at all times.  

If you don't have one, you can always use the [Ready-Made Bot](url).

The Bot is made with `py-cord`, a fork of the `discord.py` Python library. 
It is a very simple library that allows you to create a Discord bot in Python with ease.
