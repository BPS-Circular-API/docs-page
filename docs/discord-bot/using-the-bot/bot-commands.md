# Bot Commands 
Our Discord Bot has **3** main commands!

There are three circular categories. `General`, `PTM` and `Exam`. 

## User Commands
:::tip TIP

Normal user commands are prefixed with `/circular`

:::

`/circular latest [category]`: Get the latest circular of one of the three Circular categories.

`/circular list [category]`: Get the whole circular list (all the circulars) of one of the three Circular categories.

`/circular search [circular name]`: Look for a specific circular whose title keywords you remember. Example: Searching `mobile` finds and gives you the `Mobile Phone Usage Policy` circular, and it's details.

`/circular remindme`: Remind you in DMs when a new circular is released.
## Server Administrator Commands

:::tip TIP

Server administrator commands start with `/circular admin`.

:::

`/circular admin setup`: Subscribe a channel for the listener for when a new circular is posted.

`/circular admin delete`: Delete the subscription for the listener for when a new circular is posted.
