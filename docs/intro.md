# Welcome to BPS Circular API

This is the official documentation of the BPS Circular API.  
An unofficial API for getting info about circulars from the BPS Website.

This API is made by Raj and Shanvanth, primarily because nothing like this exists yet, and could be
very useful for any developer who wants to get information about BPS circulars using automation.

It is current maintained by Raj, and is completely free to use.

## What the docs contain

These docs contain help and information relating to every one of the apps we have made related to the BPS Circular API.

Navigate through the left side-panel to get started.
