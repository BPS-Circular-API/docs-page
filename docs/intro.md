# Welcome to BPS Circular API

This is the official documentation of the BPS Circular API.  
An unofficial API for getting info about circulars, from the BPS Website.

This API is made by Raj and Shanvanth, primarily because nothing like this exists yet, and could be
very useful for any developer who wants to get information about BPS circulars with automation.

## What the docs contain

These docs contain help and information relating to every one of the apps we have made related to the BPS Circular API.

Navigate through the left side-panel to get started.



### What you'll need

To use the API, you'll need basic (preferably Python) knowledge related to requests and JSON.

You can head on to the API Tab to get started.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
