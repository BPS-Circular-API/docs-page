# Introduction

For better accessibility of the API, we have created a Python Package that can be used to interact with the API. This package is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pybpsapi/). 

The package's name is `pybpsapi`. It is a simple package that allows you to interact with the API's endpoints in a simple yet powerful way. The package also features a `CircularChecker` class that allows you to check for new circulars in a category, with ease. 

## Installation

The package can be installed simply with `pip`:

```bash
pip install pybpsapi
```

And it's done! You can now use the package in your Python scripts.

## Usage

The package is very simple to use. It has only three classes, `API`, `CircularChecker` and `CircularCheckerGroup` 

It can be imported like this:

```python
import pybpsapi

# or
from pybpsapi import API, CircularChecker, CircularCheckerGroup
```

The documentation for this package is split into two parts on the basis of the classes. Proceed to the next page to begin.
