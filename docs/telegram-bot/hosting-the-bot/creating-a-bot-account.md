# Getting a Bot Account

1. Log into your Telegram account.
2. find the `@BotFather` user and send him `/start`.
3. Send him `/newbot`. When prompted, enter a name for your bot. The name can be anything you want.
4. When prompted, enter a username for your bot. The username must end with `bot`.
5. You will get a token. Save it somewhere safe. You will need it later. It looks something like this: `1234567890:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890`
6. Now, take the token and put it in the `token` variable in `/config.ini` .
