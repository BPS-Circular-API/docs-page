# Bot Commands 
Our Discord Bot has **3** main commands!

There are three circular categories. `General`, `PTM` and `Exam`. 

## User Commands

`/latest [category]`: Get the latest circular of one of the three Circular categories.

`/list [category]`: Get the whole circular list (all the circulars) of one of the three Circular categories.

`/search [circular name]`: Look for a specific circular whose title keywords you remember. Example: Searching `mobile` gets you the `Mobile Phone Usage Policy` circular and it's details.

# Group Administrator Commands

:::warning Coming Soon!

These don't exist _yet_, and I'm trying to find a way to implement this in Telegram. Thanks for your patience!
